## Project Description
Our Bias News Detector integrates SpaCy's LLM with custom rule-based algorithms to assess news content for bias. 
It evaluates sentence polarity and highlights biased statements, enabling users to discern media impartiality effectively. 
This innovative approach enhances critical reading by pinpointing bias in journalistic writing

## User Interface Specification
The user interface is created using HTML templates and CSS Styling.  The webpages consist of:
- Homepage with project description and outline
  [JTCX HOMEPAGE](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtwtZBOB204QgQfvwp2lWzZkyXjW?e=DIBxkv)
- Submission Page for user to submit a news article URL to be parsed
  [GET USER ARTICLE](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtwtZBOB204QgQhHj3tCeiUrlXJS?e=ebb6cy)
- Output Page where our algorithm outputs the Bias within the news article, also has feedback page within it for user to give feedback on our accuracy
  [OUTPUT PAGE](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtwtZBOB204QgQkO62uOPlyLXRCp?e=oihBRd)
  [OUTPUT PAGE (USER FEEDBACK)](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtwtZBOB204QgQrsNi27n-QLIKde?e=FWjtvQ)
- Feddback submission page where the user is prompted wether the feedback was valid for our database or not.

## Assessments
### Initial Self-Assessments
Summary of initial self-assessments conducted during the fall semester.

#### Jordan Shaheen:
The capstone project aims to demonstrate the comprehensive computer science skills acquired during college through the creation of a Bias News Detector, leveraging current software techniques. The choice of a challenging project over a simpler one reflects the team's ambition to maximize their capabilities. The project benefits from a strong foundation in teamwork, software application development, and machine learning from both academic courses and co-op experiences, particularly in web development with Django. The plan involves using Django for website structure and Natural Language Processing to detect biased phrases in news articles, potentially extending to news videos if time permits. The project's success will be measured by its functionality and user-friendly interface, with GitHub commits tracking the team's consistent efforts and progress.

### Final Self-Assessments
Summary of final self-assessments conducted during the spring semester. Exclude confidential team assessments.

#### Jordan Shaheen:
In my capstone project, I oversaw team progress and developed the front and back end of our website, integrating an SQL database and Docker. Drawing on my previous experience with Django and Docker, I built the website infrastructure efficiently. Our project involved creating a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) model, necessitating extensive research and team collaboration to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

We successfully implemented a pre-trained large language model, SpaCy, and enhanced its sentiment analysis through custom rules that adjusted polarity scores based on sentence embedding and dependency parsing. One major challenge was ensuring the model's reliability across various news articles. Despite some initial difficulties and my lack of experience in natural language processing, we overcame these challenges, significantly improving my skills in web development, NLP, and collaboration, contributing to the success of the project.
