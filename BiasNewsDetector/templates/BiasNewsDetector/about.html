    <h1 style="text-align: center">HOW OUR BIAS DETECTOR WORKS</h1>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        Our text analysis system is designed to deeply understand and categorize the sentiment of a given news article.
        At its core, it evaluates not just the surface-level sentiment of sentences but delves into the nuanced ways language conveys bias,
        employing a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
    </p>

    <h4>1. Initial Text Preparation:</h4>
    <p>
        The process begins with cleaning the input text to ensure a uniform structure.
        This includes removing line breaks and fixing quotation marks to prevent parsing errors.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Sentiment and Subjectivity Analysis:</h4>
    <p>
        Utilizing the 'spaCy' library enhanced with the 'SpacyTextBlob' extension,
        we first break down the article into sentences and words (tokens).
        For each sentence, we assess its overall sentiment (positive or negative) and subjectivity (objective or subjective) to classify it broadly.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Dependency Parsing:</h4>
    <p>
        The heart of our analysis lies in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences to detect how certain words modify others.
        We specifically look for negations and intensifiersâ€”words that either negate or amplify the sentiment of other words they modify.
        This step is crucial for understanding the context and nuanced meaning beyond mere word presence.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Word Embeddings Comparison:</h4>
    <p>
        To assess the sentiment further,
        we compare specific words found during dependency parsing against our pre-trained positive and negative lexicon models.
        By calculating the semantic similarity of these words to our lexicons,
        we refine our sentiment score for each sentence, thus capturing the subtle biases that may not be overtly evident.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Sentence Embedding and Similarity Analysis:</h4>
    <p>
        The culmination of our process involves generating embeddings for each sentence using a pre-trained sentence transformer model.
        These embeddings represent the semantic essence of sentences in a high-dimensional vector space.
        By comparing these embeddings, we identify sentences with semantic similarities,
        adjusting sentiment classifications based on the similarity scores.
        This allows us to understand the article's content on a deeper level,
        identifying patterns and sentiments that may not be immediately apparent.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Outcome:</h4>
    <p>
        The final output is a comprehensive analysis of the article,
        with sentences classified as positive, negative, or neutral,
        along with an indication of named entities and reasons for bias where applicable.
        This layered approach, combining syntactical analysis with semantic understanding through machine learning,
        provides a nuanced view of the text's sentiment and bias.
    </p>

    <h4>7. User Feedback:</h4>
    <p>
        Since we know that our outputs will never be perfectly accurate in every user's perception since bias is subjective,
        so we have offered users to submit feedback on sentence(s) that the bias detector missed or got wrong.
        Whenever a user submits a valid feedback form,
        the feedback is then saved within our database where we can create sentence embeddings to further train our models.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
    <p>
        This methodology enables us to move beyond basic sentiment analysis,
        offering insights into how language constructs bias and sentiment.
        By leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques,
        we achieve a detailed understanding of text, invaluable for evaluating news articles' objectivity and bias.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center">FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR BIAS NEWS DETECTOR 2.0</h1>
    <h4>1. Sentence Embeddings For Conservative and Liberal Sentences</h4>
    <p>
        Based off of User's Feedback and the AllSides news source bias rating, we have the ability to create sentence
        embeddings that contain conservative or liberal intentions within each sentence.  With these sentences, we
        can create sentence embeddings on these feedbacks.  Moreover, with sentence similarity we can infer whether a
        sentence has the connotation of being conservative or liberal.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Using Fact Checking APIs</h4>
    <p>
        Considering that our current implementation can only output bias within news articles, using a fact checking API
        can help give a more in-depth analysis within each article and give the reader a better understanding.
    </p>

    <h4>Separating Noise from Form Submission</h4>
    <p>
        One concern about the user input form submission is separating out useful information from noise.
        This comes in two areas: how to handle well-intentioned but undesirable inputs,
        and preventing malicious overloading of the server through continuous form submission.
        As bias is inherently subjective, some people's input may be incorrect or unhelpful.
        On the other hand, there are currently no checks to prevent mass dumping of forms from malicious users.
    </p>

    <h4>Bad Faith Form Submission</h4>
    <p>
        A larger concern about form submission comes from targeted bad faith submission with the intent to undermine the detector.
        A bad actor could attempt to drift the detector over time with specific form submission,
        like trying to change the sentiment towards certain sentences.
        Solutions to the above issues may end up quite involved,
        as detecting these issues might require direct human oversight.
    </p>

    <h4>Paywall/Member Requirements Preventing Scraping</h4>
    <p>
        One goal for the scraper is to set up a system allowing members of different news sites to scrape articles they can access,
        but the public can't. Currently, some articles are prevented from being scraped due to paywall or member requirements.
        Setting up some method of allowing users that access would be a great user experience upgrade.
