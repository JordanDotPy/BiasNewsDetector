    <h1 style="text-align: center">HOW OUR BIAS DETECTOR WORKS</h1>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        Our text analysis system is designed to deeply understand and categorize the sentiment of a given news article.
        At its core, it evaluates not just the surface-level sentiment of sentences but delves into the nuanced ways language conveys bias,
        employing a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
    </p>

    <h4>1. Initial Text Preparation:</h4>
    <p>
        The process begins with cleaning the input text to ensure a uniform structure.
        This includes removing line breaks and fixing quotation marks to prevent parsing errors.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Sentiment and Subjectivity Analysis:</h4>
    <p>
        Utilizing the 'spaCy' library enhanced with the 'SpacyTextBlob' extension,
        we first break down the article into sentences and words (tokens).
        For each sentence, we assess its overall sentiment (positive or negative) and subjectivity (objective or subjective) to classify it broadly.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Dependency Parsing:</h4>
    <p>
        The heart of our analysis lies in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences to detect how certain words modify others.
        We specifically look for negations and intensifiersâ€”words that either negate or amplify the sentiment of other words they modify.
        This step is crucial for understanding the context and nuanced meaning beyond mere word presence.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Word Embeddings Comparison:</h4>
    <p>
        To assess the sentiment further,
        we compare specific words found during dependency parsing against our pre-trained positive and negative lexicon models.
        By calculating the semantic similarity of these words to our lexicons,
        we refine our sentiment score for each sentence, thus capturing the subtle biases that may not be overtly evident.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Sentence Embedding and Similarity Analysis:</h4>
    <p>
        The culmination of our process involves generating embeddings for each sentence using a pre-trained sentence transformer model.
        These embeddings represent the semantic essence of sentences in a high-dimensional vector space.
        By comparing these embeddings, we identify sentences with semantic similarities,
        adjusting sentiment classifications based on the similarity scores.
        This allows us to understand the article's content on a deeper level,
        identifying patterns and sentiments that may not be immediately apparent.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Outcome:</h4>
    <p>
        The final output is a comprehensive analysis of the article,
        with sentences classified as positive, negative, or neutral,
        along with an indication of named entities and reasons for bias where applicable.
        This layered approach, combining syntactical analysis with semantic understanding through machine learning,
        provides a nuanced view of the text's sentiment and bias.
    </p>

    <h4>7. User Feedback:</h4>
    <p>
        Since we know that our outputs will never be perfectly accurate in every user's perception since bias is subjective,
        so we have offered users to submit feedback on sentence(s) that the bias detector missed or got wrong.
        Whenever a user submits a valid feedback form,
        the feedback is then saved within our database where we can create sentence embeddings to further train our models.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
    <p>
        This methodology enables us to move beyond basic sentiment analysis,
        offering insights into how language constructs bias and sentiment.
        By leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques,
        we achieve a detailed understanding of text, invaluable for evaluating news articles' objectivity and bias.
